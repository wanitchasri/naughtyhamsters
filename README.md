Remark: This project was implemented as a part of Senior Project I course at VMS ABAC. Note that there exist addressed, unresolved bugs in the project.

**Game Setup** <br />
* 4 players per game
* 2 roles: guard or seeker/food finder <br />
* A round(day) of game is divided into 4 phases: finding food, storing food, discussion, and investigation. <br />
At the beginning of each round, one of the players will be randomly selected as guard of the day. 

---
**How to Play** <br />
* There are two types of foods; human food and hamster food. <br />
* Players compete to get the highest amount of calories. Human foods have higher calories, however is prohibited, thus have to be sneaked in. <br />
* With the guard standing by every day, seekers need to be more careful on what they bring home. <br />
* The guard that suspects the wrong seeker, will have their calories diminished. <br />
* Each game phase proceeds according to the set timer, meaning that players are given only a certain period of time to achieve their goals of that phase <br />

<ins>Phase 1: Finding food.</ins> <br />
At the beginning of a day, the seekers found a set of foods where they can choose to either keep or change them. Note that they will only have one chance to change it. <br />

<ins>Phase 2: Storing and Returning home</ins> <br />
The foods that seeker found may consist of both hamster and human foods. 
Keeping in mind that human foods are prohibited, the seekers pick which foods they want to store before returning home. <br />

<ins>Phase 3: Discussion</ins> <br />
Once every seeker got their food home, every player can discuss freely. The guard should take this advantage to find out who sneaked in human foods. <br />

<ins>Phase 4: Investigation</ins> <br />
The guard selects a seeker to investigate. Correct investigation will result in seizing human foods, so all those calories will be given to the guard instead. 
Otherwise, the guard will lose half the calories of the foods investigated. <br />

After investigation, roles are swapped, proceeding to another day until every player has once become a guard. <br />
